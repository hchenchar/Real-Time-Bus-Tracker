# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Project Description: This project sources real-time data of Boston MBTA busses to display the live locations of the busses on a map by showing the stops between MIT and Harvard illustrated by a pin. The files utilized for this project include Mapbox's v1.11.0 API documents.

How to Run: Save the file to your system by downloading the index.html file in this repository. After saving, drag and drop the file onto your browser. To begin the animation, click on the button labeled "Stops Between MIT and Harvard" and follow the pin as it moves across the map to illustrate the location of each bus stop.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Looking ahead, I would like to continue to improve the styling of this animation and add in more details for each stop in order to make the information more easily identifiable.
